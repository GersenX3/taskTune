                    Welcome to Task tune, a task manager that will recommend a
                    song for the task you are performing.
                    <br />

                <p>
                    Underneath the text of your task you will see the song we
                    recommend you to perform, the artist, the photo of their
                    album and a direct link to that song on Spotify.
                    <br />

                    When you have a sea of tasks you can search for the one you
                    need with a keyword, so you can mark it as completed or do
                    whatever you need to do with it.
